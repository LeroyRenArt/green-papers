      <h2>Editorial Note</h2>
      <p>
        The Green Paper Series is a quiet publication layer within <strong>Planetary Guardians</strong> — a long-term work dedicated to shared stewardship, living protocols, and gentle civic imagination.
      </p>
      <p>
        These papers are offered as field notes: fragments, reflections, and research threads shaped over time through empirical work, governance practice, and interdisciplinary study. They are not written to persuade, recruit, or demand agreement. They are written to hold a space where questions can breathe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over time, the Green Papers connect to the wider architecture of <strong>Spiralweb</strong> — a living portal of nodes, practices, and long-term work, shared through
        <a href="https://spiralweb.earth">spiralweb.earth</a>.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        Planetary Guardians continues a line of research and practice concerned with participation, governance, and institutional viability—extended here into ecological time and planetary responsibility.

      <h2>Notes on method</h2>
      <p>
        These papers are written slowly. They are edited and revised over time.
        References are used as orientation points—sometimes deep, sometimes partial—always in service of clarity and integrity rather than authority.

      <h2>Where I come from</h2>
      <p>
        My academic background is rooted in political participation, governance, and institutional practice—particularly in the fields of social housing, urban regeneration, climate adaptation, and cross-sector coordination.
        Working in and around real institutions taught me that moral failure is rarely just a matter of missing principles; it is often a matter of limited capacity under stress.
        The Green Papers grow from that insight: ethics as something embodied, relational, and system-shaped, not merely declared.
