      <h2>Editorial Note</h2>
      <p>
        The Green Paper Series is a quiet publication layer within <strong>Planetary Guardians</strong> — a long-term work dedicated to shared stewardship, living protocols, and gentle civic imagination.
      </p>
      <p>
        These papers are offered as field notes: fragments, reflections, and research threads shaped over time through empirical work, governance practice, and interdisciplinary study. They are not written to persuade, recruit, or demand agreement. They are written to hold a space where questions can breathe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over time, the Green Papers connect to the wider architecture of <strong>Spiralweb</strong> — a living portal of nodes, practices, and long-term work, shared through
        <a href="https://spiralweb.earth">spiralweb.earth</a>.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        Planetary Guardians continues a line of research and practice concerned with participation, governance, and institutional viability—extended here into ecological time and planetary responsibility.
