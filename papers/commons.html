      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        This paper explores stewardship as a social and institutional capability.
        “Commons” are not only resources; they are relationships and governance forms:
        ways of holding shared value without collapsing into either privatization or neglect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Trust is central to commons governance, yet trust cannot be demanded.
        It emerges from repeated repair, legitimacy, and lived experience of fairness.
        When trust declines, systems become punitive, procedural, or extractive—
        even when good intentions remain.
      </p>
      <p>
        The paper proposes local stewardship as a viability practice:
        small-scale responsibility carried with clarity, participation,
        and care for the conditions that sustain cooperation.

      <h2>1. Why commons matter now</h2>
      <p>
        Planetary constraint forces renewed attention to shared goods:
        water, soil, air, housing, infrastructures of care, public space,
        and the conditions for local survival.
      </p>
      <p>
        In such times, the commons question becomes unavoidable:
        how do we hold shared resources without collapsing into conflict,
        enclosure, or exhaustion?
      </p>
      <p>
        Commons governance is not sentimental. It is practical.
        It asks what coordination structures can endure under pressure.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Trust as governance infrastructure</h2>
      <p>
        Trust is often treated as an emotion or a cultural trait.
        But it also functions as infrastructure:
        it reduces transaction costs, makes cooperation possible,
        and allows disagreement without collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where trust is high, systems can be flexible.
        Where trust is low, systems become rigid.
      </p>
      <p>
        Trust tends to decline when:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>responsibility is unclear</li>
        <li>benefits and burdens feel unfair</li>
        <li>people are unheard or excluded</li>
        <li>repair mechanisms are missing</li>
        <li>institutions become procedural substitutes for legitimacy</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Trust cannot be demanded. It must be earned through lived practice.
      </p>
    </section>

      <h2>3. Stewardship: responsibility that can be carried</h2>
      <p>
        Stewardship is a form of responsibility that relates to continuity.
        It is less about control and more about maintenance, care, and guardianship.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stewardship becomes possible when responsibility is:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>clearly defined</li>
        <li>locally intelligible</li>
        <li>supported by participation</li>
        <li>matched with capacity</li>
        <li>held with legitimacy rather than coercion</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Stewardship collapses when responsibility is distributed without support,
        or when systems punish people for not carrying what no one can carry.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Commons governance is not “no rules”</h2>
      <p>
        A common misunderstanding is that commons governance means openness without structure.
        In practice, commons require rules—often more subtle and relational than state law or market contracts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Commons governance typically depends on:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>clear boundaries of the shared resource</li>
        <li>shared agreement on use and contribution</li>
        <li>monitoring that is locally legitimate</li>
        <li>graduated responses to harm</li>
        <li>accessible conflict resolution</li>
        <li>the ability to revise rules over time</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In other words: commons survive through adaptive coherence.
      </p>

      <h2>5. The local scale: small enough to repair</h2>
      <p>
        Many governance failures happen because systems become too abstract
        to remain connected to lived reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Local stewardship matters because the local scale remains:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>visible</li>
        <li>concrete</li>
        <li>repairable</li>
        <li>relational</li>
        <li>capable of feedback</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This does not mean the local scale is always harmonious.
        It means it provides conditions where repair is possible.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Planetary guardianship as commons practice</h2>
      <p>
        Planetary guardianship is not only global governance.
        It also requires commons competence:
        the everyday ability to coordinate, maintain, and protect shared conditions of life.
      </p>
      <p>
        The commons frame shifts the question from “who should win” to “what must endure.”
      </p>
      <p>
        It offers a quiet ethic:
        responsibility held close enough to be carried,
        shared enough to be legitimate,
        and adaptive enough to remain viable.
      </p>

      <h2>Closing questions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Which shared resources are becoming commons again under constraint?</li>
        <li>Where is trust being depleted faster than it can be repaired?</li>
        <li>What forms of local governance remain viable under pressure?</li>
        <li>How do we protect stewardship from burnout and moralization?</li>
        <li>What institutional designs support commons without crushing them?</li>
