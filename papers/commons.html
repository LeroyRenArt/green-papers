      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        This paper explores stewardship as a social and institutional capability.
        “Commons” are not only resources; they are relationships and governance forms:
        ways of holding shared value without collapsing into either privatization or neglect.
      </p>
    </section>

      <h2>1. Why commons matter now</h2>
      <p>
        Planetary constraint forces renewed attention to shared goods:
        water, soil, air, housing, infrastructures of care, public space,
        and the conditions for local survival.
      </p>
    </section>

      <h2>2. Trust as governance infrastructure</h2>
      <p>
        Trust is often treated as an emotion or a cultural trait.
        But it also functions as infrastructure: it reduces transaction costs, makes cooperation possible,
        and allows disagreement without collapse.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="block">
      <h2>3. Stewardship: responsibility that can be carried</h2>
      <p>
        Stewardship is a form of responsibility that relates to continuity.
        It is less about control and more about maintenance, care, and guardianship.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="block">
      <h2>4. Commons governance is not “no rules”</h2>
      <p>
        A common misunderstanding is that commons governance means openness without structure.
        In practice, commons require rules—often more subtle and relational than state law or market contracts.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="block">
      <h2>5. The local scale: small enough to repair</h2>
      <p>
        Many governance failures happen because systems become too abstract to remain connected to lived reality.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="block">
      <h2>6. Planetary guardianship as commons practice</h2>
      <p>
        Planetary guardianship is not only global governance. It also requires commons competence:
        the everyday ability to coordinate, maintain, and protect shared conditions of life.
      </p>

      <h2>Methods / Editorial note</h2>
      <p>
        These Green Papers are written as field notes and working reflections. The drafting process combined (1) authorial writing and revision, (2) iterative prompts to an AI language model for drafting and editing, and (3) conventional editorial revision. Key practices:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>AI assistance:</strong> The AI produced early drafts and suggested language; the author reviewed and revised every paragraph.</li>
        <li><strong>Sourcing:</strong> The papers use a “working bibliography” as orientation rather than a formal literature review. Citations are selective; empirical claims should be verified before formal use.</li>
        <li><strong>Verification:</strong> The author is responsible for verification of cited sources and accepts responsibility for errors. Prior to academic submission, each reference and empirical claim should be independently checked and expanded.</li>
        <li><strong>Versioning:</strong> Each paper carries a version line (v0.1). Substantial revisions will be tracked in a change log at Planetary Guardians / Spiralweb.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Closing questions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Which shared resources are becoming commons again under constraint?</li>
        <li>Where is trust being depleted faster than it can be repaired?</li>
        <li>What forms of local governance remain viable under pressure?</li>
        <li>How do we protect stewardship from burnout and moralization?</li>
        <li>What institutional designs support commons without crushing them?</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
