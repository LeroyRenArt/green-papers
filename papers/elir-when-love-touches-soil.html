<p>Elir: When Love Touches Soil</p>
<h3>A Green Paper on grounded value, living limits, and care made measurable without becoming extractive</h3>
<p><strong>Status:</strong> Green Paper (living)</p>
<hr />
<h3>1. Why love must touch ground</h3>
<p>Care that remains abstract becomes sentiment. Care that touches ground becomes responsibility.</p>
<p>Elir names the moment where love leaves intention and enters <strong>place</strong>.</p>
<p>Not everywhere. Not all at once.</p>
<p>Here.</p>
<hr />
<h3>2. Elir is not money</h3>
<p>Elir is frequently misunderstood because it resembles currency.</p>
<p>This resemblance is superficial.</p>
<p>Elir:</p>
<p>* does not accumulate power</p>
<p>* does not earn interest</p>
<p>* does not circulate freely</p>
<p>* does not reward speed</p>
<p>Elir measures <strong>commitment to place</strong>, not purchasing power.</p>
<hr />
<h3>3. The 10 m² pixel</h3>
<p>Elir is bound to a minimum viable unit of habitat: <strong>10 square meters</strong>.</p>
<p>This unit is:</p>
<p>* small enough to be known</p>
<p>* large enough to host life</p>
<p>* finite</p>
<p>* specific</p>
<p>The pixel is not symbolic. It is literal soil, water, fungi, roots, insects, and care.</p>
<hr />
<h3>4. Why the pixel matters</h3>
<p>Abstraction scales easily. Care does not.</p>
<p>The pixel prevents:</p>
<p>* moral inflation</p>
<p>* financial capture</p>
<p>* anonymous harm</p>
<p>One cannot claim care for more ground than one can meaningfully hold in attention.</p>
<hr />
<h3>5. Ceilings as love</h3>
<p>Elir includes a ceiling.</p>
<p>Not as control, but as protection.</p>
<p>The ceiling ensures:</p>
<p>* no single actor dominates a place</p>
<p>* no extraction masquerades as generosity</p>
<p>* rotation remains possible</p>
<p>Unlimited giving would collapse relation. Limits keep love breathable.</p>
<hr />
<h3>6. Stewardship without ownership</h3>
<p>Elir creates <strong>stewards</strong>, not owners.</p>
<p>A steward:</p>
<p>* tends without possessing</p>
<p>* cares without controlling</p>
<p>* remains accountable to the living system</p>
<p>Ownership freezes relation. Stewardship keeps it alive.</p>
<hr />
<h3>7. Time as a co-currency</h3>
<p>Soil works in years, not quarters.</p>
<p>Elir therefore carries time implicitly.</p>
<p>Care expressed today may only bloom later. Elir honors this delay.</p>
<p>Patience is not inefficiency. It is ecological intelligence.</p>
<hr />
<h3>8. Elir and commons governance</h3>
<p>Because Elir is place-bound:</p>
<p>* decisions remain local</p>
<p>* feedback is immediate</p>
<p>* repair is possible</p>
<p>This aligns Elir naturally with commons governance and polycentric care.</p>
<hr />
<h3>9. What Elir refuses</h3>
<p>Elir refuses:</p>
<p>* speculation</p>
<p>* anonymity</p>
<p>* acceleration</p>
<p>* abstraction without consequence</p>
<p>These refusals are not ideological. They are protective.</p>
<hr />
<h3>10. Keeping Elir clean</h3>
<p>Elir becomes polluted when:</p>
<p>* it is treated as transferable value</p>
<p>* it is disconnected from land</p>
<p>* ceilings are removed</p>
<p>To keep Elir clean:</p>
<p>* stay local</p>
<p>* stay finite</p>
<p>* stay slow</p>
<hr />
<h3>Closing</h3>
<p>Elir is love that has agreed to be limited.</p>
<p>When love accepts limits, it can finally take responsibility.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>This paper anchors value in soil and time. All subsequent papers depend on this grounding to avoid abstraction and capture.</em></p>
