      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        This paper explores care as a viability condition. Care is often treated as a moral ideal or a personal virtue,
        but it is also a systemic capacity: something that requires time, attention, trust, and institutional support.
      </p>
      <p>
        In overloaded systems, care becomes fragile. It collapses not only through cruelty, but through exhaustion,
        fragmentation, and the disappearance of repair. Viability, in this context, refers to the ability of people,
        relationships, and institutions to remain coherent enough for responsibility to be carried over time.

      <h2>1. Care is not only intention</h2>
      <p>
        Many societies speak of care as a value. Many institutions speak of care as a principle.
        Individuals often hold care as an aspiration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet care is not sustained by intention alone.
        It requires capacity: time, stability, and access to repair.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="block">
      <h2>2. Viability as a quiet ethical concept</h2>
      <p>
        Viability means the capacity to remain alive and coherent through change.
        It is not perfection. It is not growth. It is the ability to continue without collapse.
      </p>

      <h2>3. The hidden costs of care</h2>
      <p>
        Care is not free. Even when it is offered lovingly, it has costs:
        emotional labor, time, responsibility load, and exposure to other people’s distress.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="block">
      <h2>4. Institutions that ask for care while removing its conditions</h2>
      <p>
        Many contemporary institutions demand care rhetorically while making it practically impossible.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="block">
      <h2>5. Care under planetary constraint</h2>
      <p>
        Planetary instability changes the ethical landscape.
        Care is no longer only a local interpersonal matter.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="block">
      <h2>6. A practical orientation</h2>
      <p>
        The point of this paper is not to define care.
        The point is to protect the conditions that allow care to remain possible.

      <h2>Methods / Editorial note</h2>
      <p>
        These Green Papers are written as field notes and working reflections. The drafting process combined (1) authorial writing and revision, (2) iterative prompts to an AI language model for drafting and editing, and (3) conventional editorial revision. Key practices:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>AI assistance:</strong> The AI produced early drafts and suggested language; the author reviewed and revised every paragraph.</li>
        <li><strong>Sourcing:</strong> The papers use a “working bibliography” as orientation rather than a formal literature review. Citations are selective; empirical claims should be verified before formal use.</li>
        <li><strong>Verification:</strong> The author is responsible for verification of cited sources and accepts responsibility for errors. Prior to academic submission, each reference and empirical claim should be independently checked and expanded.</li>
        <li><strong>Versioning:</strong> Each paper carries a version line (v0.1). Substantial revisions will be tracked in a change log at Planetary Guardians / Spiralweb.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="block">
      <h2>Closing questions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>What makes care sustainable rather than heroic?</li>
        <li>Where does care collapse first: body, relation, or institution?</li>
        <li>Which institutional designs consistently produce overload?</li>
        <li>What forms of repair restore viability after rupture?</li>
        <li>How do we carry planetary responsibility without burning out?</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
