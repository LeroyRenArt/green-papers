<p>Nervous-System Love</p>
<h3>A Green Paper on regulation, capacity, and care as a physiological intelligence</h3>
<p><strong>Status:</strong> Green Paper (living)</p>
<hr />
<h3>1. Love as regulation</h3>
<p>Nervous-System Love names a simple fact: love that overwhelms capacity is not love.</p>
<p>Care becomes extractive when it ignores physiology. Genuine care supports <strong>regulation</strong>—the body’s ability to return to a workable range after disturbance.</p>
<p>Love, here, is not sentiment. It is <strong>capacity protection</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3>2. Capacity before consent</h3>
<p>Consent is only meaningful when the nervous system is regulated.</p>
<p>Under threat, urgency, or overload, bodies comply without choosing. Nervous-System Love therefore prioritizes conditions where choice can occur:</p>
<p>* sufficient safety</p>
<p>* adequate time</p>
<p>* tolerable intensity</p>
<p>Without these, consent collapses into survival behavior.</p>
<hr />
<h3>3. The window of tolerance</h3>
<p>Bodies operate within windows.</p>
<p>Inside the window, curiosity, empathy, and agency are possible. Outside it, bodies default to defense.</p>
<p>Nervous-System Love works to:</p>
<p>* widen the window gently</p>
<p>* prevent chronic overwhelm</p>
<p>* normalize rest and pause</p>
<p>Regulation precedes growth.</p>
<hr />
<h3>4. Pressure as information</h3>
<p>Pressure is not a motivator; it is a diagnostic signal.</p>
<p>When pressure increases:</p>
<p>* attention narrows</p>
<p>* empathy drops</p>
<p>* time collapses</p>
<p>Systems that rely on pressure train bodies toward extraction. Nervous-System Love removes unnecessary pressure first.</p>
<hr />
<h3>5. Care without urgency</h3>
<p>Urgency is a physiological state.</p>
<p>When urgency is constant, bodies cannot repair. Nervous-System Love treats urgency as an exception, not a baseline.</p>
<p>Care slows pace so bodies can remain present.</p>
<hr />
<h3>6. Collective regulation</h3>
<p>Regulation is not solely individual.</p>
<p>Shared rhythms—breathing, pacing, turn-taking—support collective regulation. This is the somatic basis of commons and Penguin Economics.</p>
<p>Care architectures must regulate <strong>groups</strong>, not just individuals.</p>
<hr />
<h3>7. Technology and regulation</h3>
<p>Technology amplifies signals.</p>
<p>Under Nervous-System Love:</p>
<p>* technology must not accelerate beyond bodily capacity</p>
<p>* feedback loops must include pause</p>
<p>* automation must preserve human judgment</p>
<p>Systems that bypass regulation bypass humanity.</p>
<hr />
<h3>8. Conflict and repair</h3>
<p>Conflict is inevitable.</p>
<p>Repair is not.</p>
<p>Nervous-System Love designs for repair by:</p>
<p>* allowing time-outs</p>
<p>* reducing public exposure</p>
<p>* prioritizing private regulation before public resolution</p>
<p>Repair requires bodies that can feel.</p>
<hr />
<h3>9. What Nervous-System Love refuses</h3>
<p>It refuses:</p>
<p>* pressure-based motivation</p>
<p>* moral shaming</p>
<p>* urgency theater</p>
<p>* optimization at the cost of capacity</p>
<p>These erode regulation.</p>
<hr />
<h3>10. Keeping Nervous-System Love clean</h3>
<p>This field becomes polluted when:</p>
<p>* care is used to push</p>
<p>* growth outruns regulation</p>
<p>* systems ignore exhaustion</p>
<p>To keep it clean:</p>
<p>* slow the pace</p>
<p>* widen windows gently</p>
<p>* normalize rest</p>
<hr />
<h3>Closing</h3>
<p>Nervous-System Love is not softness.</p>
<p>It is <strong>precision</strong>.</p>
<p>Only regulated bodies can choose. Only choosing bodies can care.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>This paper establishes regulation as a prerequisite for dignity, consent, and sustainable care across all systems.</em></p>
