      <p class="muted"><strong>Author’s note — AI co-creation.</strong> These papers are working notes authored by Lars A. Engberg. They were drafted and edited in conversation with an AI language model (<em>GPT-5 Thinking mini</em>). The AI assisted with phrasing, organization, and initial drafting; the author curated, edited, and is fully responsible for substantive claims, omissions, and interpretations. Where passages were substantially shaped by the AI, this is indicated in the editorial log. The work is offered as field notes and an experiment in collaborative composition rather than a finished, peer-reviewed product.</p>

      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        Beauty is commonly treated as luxury; this paper treats it as infrastructure. Beauty orients perception, deepens care, and sustains attention. It is a stabilizer for long-term stewardship because it works on human motivation and meaning.

      <h2>1. Beauty and attention</h2>
      <p>
        Beauty organizes attention. When environments are arranged with clarity, proportion, and tactility, they invite sustained regard. That sustained regard is a necessary condition for long-term care.
      </p>
    </section>

      <h2>2. Not luxury: beauty as stabilizer</h2>
      <p>
        Beauty functions as a low-cost stabilizer: small acts of design, repair, and tending generate outsized effects on how people value place and act within it. Beauty is therefore civic grammar, not mere taste.

      <h2>3. An ecology of perception</h2>
      <p>
        Perception is ecological: it depends on sequences, contrast, and habit. An ecology of perception cultivates thresholds, focal points, and ordinary aesthetics that shape careful behavior across communities.
      </p>

    <section class="block">
      <h2>4. Distributing care and avoiding exclusivity</h2>
      <p>
        Beauty can be hoarded. Policy must prevent aesthetic privilege by investing aesthetic care in shared spaces: schools, transit, commons. When beauty is widely available it becomes a public resource that supports distributed stewardship.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="block">
      <h2>5. Practices and principles</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Design for legibility: cues that invite correct use and maintenance.</li>
        <li>Make maintenance visible and public, linking labor to care and recognition.</li>
        <li>Favor modest, reproducible gestures over bespoke spectacle.</li>
        <li>Embed beauty in everyday infrastructure: paths, benches, edges, thresholds.</li>
        <li>Support a plurality of aesthetic practices that reflect local meanings.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Methods / Editorial note</h2>
      <p>
        These Green Papers are written as field notes and working reflections. The drafting process combined (1) authorial writing and revision, (2) iterative prompts to an AI language model for drafting and editing, and (3) conventional editorial revision. Key practices:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>AI assistance:</strong> The AI produced early drafts and suggested language; the author reviewed and revised every paragraph.</li>
        <li><strong>Sourcing:</strong> The papers use a “working bibliography” as orientation rather than a formal literature review. Citations are selective; empirical claims should be verified before formal use.</li>
        <li><strong>Verification:</strong> The author is responsible for verification of cited sources and accepts responsibility for errors. Prior to academic submission, each reference and empirical claim should be independently checked and expanded.</li>
        <li><strong>Versioning:</strong> Each paper carries a version line (v0.1). Substantial revisions will be tracked in a change log at Planetary Guardians / Spiralweb.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="block">
      <h2>Closing questions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>How can public policy support distributed aesthetic care without prescribing taste?</li>
        <li>What minimal design cues reliably attract care and discourage neglect?</li>
        <li>How to make maintenance labor visible and honored in civic spaces?</li>
        <li>How can small acts of beauty be scaled across unevenly resourced communities?</li>
        <li>What metrics could show the civic value of beauty?</li>
      </ul>
