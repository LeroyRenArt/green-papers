      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        Beauty is commonly treated as luxury; this paper treats it as infrastructure. Beauty orients perception, deepens care, and sustains attention. It is a stabilizer for long-term stewardship because it works on human motivation and meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Understanding beauty as part of civic and ecological design means cultivating perceptual ecologies: landscapes, places, and objects that invite attention, invite repair, and foster responsibility without coercion.
      </p>
      <p>
        The paper offers practical prescriptions: attend to perceptual scale, cultivate mundane beauty, and distribute aesthetic care so that beauty supports equitable stewardship rather than exclusive consumption.

      <h2>1. Beauty and attention</h2>
      <p>
        Beauty organizes attention. When environments are arranged with clarity, proportion, and tactility, they invite sustained regard. That sustained regard is a necessary condition for long-term care.

      <h2>2. Not luxury: beauty as stabilizer</h2>
      <p>
        Beauty functions as a low-cost stabilizer: small acts of design, repair, and tending generate outsized effects on how people value place and act within it. Beauty is therefore civic grammar, not mere taste.

      <h2>3. An ecology of perception</h2>
      <p>
        Perception is ecological: it depends on sequences, contrast, and habit. An ecology of perception cultivates thresholds, focal points, and ordinary aesthetics that shape careful behavior across communities.

      <h2>4. Distributing care and avoiding exclusivity</h2>
      <p>
        Beauty can be hoarded. Policy must prevent aesthetic privilege by investing aesthetic care in shared spaces: schools, transit, commons. When beauty is widely available it becomes a public resource that supports distributed stewardship.

      <h2>5. Practices and principles</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Design for legibility: cues that invite correct use and maintenance.</li>
        <li>Make maintenance visible and public, linking labor to care and recognition.</li>
        <li>Favor modest, reproducible gestures over bespoke spectacle.</li>
        <li>Embed beauty in everyday infrastructure: paths, benches, edges, thresholds.</li>
        <li>Support a plurality of aesthetic practices that reflect local meanings.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section class="block">
      <h2>Closing questions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>How can public policy support distributed aesthetic care without prescribing taste?</li>
        <li>What minimal design cues reliably attract care and discourage neglect?</li>
        <li>How to make maintenance labor visible and honored in civic spaces?</li>
        <li>How can small acts of beauty be scaled across unevenly resourced communities?</li>
        <li>What metrics could show the civic value of beauty?</li>
      </ul>
