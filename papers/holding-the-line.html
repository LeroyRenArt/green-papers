<p>Planetary Guardianship: Holding the Line</p>
<h3>A Green Paper on stewardship without domination, care without heroism, and standing watch for life</h3>
<p><strong>Status:</strong> Green Paper (living)</p>
<hr />
<h3>1. Why guardianship, not ownership</h3>
<p>The planet does not need owners. It does not need managers. It does not need saviors.</p>
<p>What it needs is <strong>guardianship</strong>.</p>
<p>Guardianship differs from ownership in one decisive way: the guardian does not claim what they protect. They stand watch so life can continue without being claimed.</p>
<hr />
<h3>2. Holding the line</h3>
<p>To hold the line is not to advance.</p>
<p>It is to say: <em>no further extraction here.</em></p>
<p>Holding the line means:</p>
<p>* refusing escalation</p>
<p>* refusing shortcuts</p>
<p>* refusing to trade future life for present gain</p>
<p>This is not passivity. It is discipline.</p>
<hr />
<h3>3. Guardianship without heroism</h3>
<p>Heroism concentrates attention and burns out bodies.</p>
<p>Planetary Guardianship rejects the hero narrative. No one stands alone at the edge.</p>
<p>Guardianship rotates. Responsibility circulates. Exposure is shared.</p>
<p>This keeps watch sustainable.</p>
<hr />
<h3>4. Attention as the primary act</h3>
<p>Guardianship begins with attention.</p>
<p>Attention notices:</p>
<p>* early signs of degradation</p>
<p>* subtle boundary crossings</p>
<p>* quiet signals from bodies and habitats</p>
<p>What is noticed early can be repaired gently.</p>
<hr />
<h3>5. Limits as love</h3>
<p>Guardians do not enforce limits to punish.</p>
<p>They hold limits to preserve conditions for life.</p>
<p>Limits prevent tragedy from becoming inevitable.</p>
<hr />
<h3>6. Planetary scale, local action</h3>
<p>Planetary Guardianship does not operate from above.</p>
<p>It emerges locally:</p>
<p>* in watersheds</p>
<p>* in food forests</p>
<p>* in communities</p>
<p>* in bodies</p>
<p>The planetary emerges from the protected local.</p>
<hr />
<h3>7. Governance as watchkeeping</h3>
<p>Governance, under guardianship, is not command.</p>
<p>It is watchkeeping:</p>
<p>* noticing drift</p>
<p>* calling pauses</p>
<p>* inviting repair</p>
<p>Power remains provisional.</p>
<hr />
<h3>8. Technology under guardianship</h3>
<p>Technology can assist guardianship by:</p>
<p>* making slow harm visible</p>
<p>* supporting transparency</p>
<p>* extending perception</p>
<p>Technology must never outrun responsibility.</p>
<hr />
<h3>9. What guardianship refuses</h3>
<p>Planetary Guardianship refuses:</p>
<p>* domination</p>
<p>* acceleration</p>
<p>* sacrifice narratives</p>
<p>* salvation myths</p>
<p>Life does not need saving. It needs space.</p>
<hr />
<h3>10. Keeping the line clean</h3>
<p>The line becomes polluted when:</p>
<p>* guardians seek recognition</p>
<p>* limits become rigid</p>
<p>* vigilance turns into control</p>
<p>To keep the line clean:</p>
<p>* rotate watch</p>
<p>* rest often</p>
<p>* listen continuously</p>
<hr />
<h3>Closing</h3>
<p>Planetary Guardianship is not an endpoint.</p>
<p>It is a stance.</p>
<p>To hold the line is to love life enough <strong>not to take more from it</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>This paper completes the Green Paper series by articulating guardianship as sustained care without capture, heroism, or domination.</em></p>
