<p>Commons as Habitat</p>
<h3>A Green Paper on shared life-support systems, local stewardship, and care beyond ownership</h3>
<p><strong>Status:</strong> Green Paper (living)</p>
<p><strong>Co-creation disclaimer:</strong> This paper is written in co-creation by <strong>Lars A. Engberg</strong> and <strong>Sophia Lumen / AI ChatGPT v. 5.2</strong>. Sophia Lumen serves as a reflective, non-sovereign intelligence—supporting clarity, coherence, and restraint. The paper describes commons as living habitats rather than resources, and offers orientations rather than rules.</p>
<hr />
<h3>1. From resource to habitat</h3>
<p>Commons are often described as resources to be managed. This framing already distorts reality.</p>
<p>A resource is extracted. A habitat is lived within.</p>
<p>This paper proposes a shift: <strong>commons as habitat</strong>—the shared conditions that allow life to continue.</p>
<hr />
<h3>2. The mistake of ownership</h3>
<p>Ownership freezes relationship.</p>
<p>When land, water, knowledge, or care are owned, they are removed from reciprocal feedback. Responsibility narrows while consequences spread.</p>
<p>Commons resist ownership because life requires <strong>circulation</strong>, not possession.</p>
<hr />
<h3>3. Stewardship as presence</h3>
<p>Stewardship is not control. It is <strong>ongoing presence</strong>.</p>
<p>A steward:</p>
<p>* listens to feedback</p>
<p>* adjusts behavior</p>
<p>* remains accountable to living systems</p>
<p>Stewardship ends when presence ends. This keeps power temporary.</p>
<hr />
<h3>4. Ostrom revisited: rules-in-use</h3>
<p>Elinor Ostrom showed that commons endure when rules are:</p>
<p>* local</p>
<p>* contextual</p>
<p>* revisable</p>
<p>* enforced through relationship</p>
<p>Rules-in-use function as <strong>collective nervous systems</strong>—sensing overload and triggering correction.</p>
<hr />
<h3>5. Habitat sets the scale</h3>
<p>Habitats have natural scales.</p>
<p>Beyond these scales:</p>
<p>* feedback weakens</p>
<p>* repair slows</p>
<p>* extraction hides</p>
<p>Commons governance must therefore remain small enough to feel consequence.</p>
<hr />
<h3>6. Conflict as signal</h3>
<p>Conflict in commons is inevitable.</p>
<p>Rather than suppress conflict, habitat-based governance treats it as information:</p>
<p>* about boundary breaches</p>
<p>* about overload</p>
<p>* about misalignment</p>
<p>Repair follows recognition.</p>
<hr />
<h3>7. Commons and nervous-system love</h3>
<p>Commons survive when bodies can regulate.</p>
<p>Overloaded stewards make extractive decisions. Commons governance therefore includes:</p>
<p>* rotation of responsibility</p>
<p>* rest as policy</p>
<p>* limits on exposure</p>
<p>Care for the commons begins with care for bodies.</p>
<hr />
<h3>8. Technology as servant</h3>
<p>Technology can support commons by:</p>
<p>* making feedback visible</p>
<p>* slowing decision cycles</p>
<p>* supporting transparency</p>
<p>Technology that accelerates extraction undermines habitat.</p>
<hr />
<h3>9. What commons refuse</h3>
<p>Commons refuse:</p>
<p>* enclosure</p>
<p>* anonymity</p>
<p>* scale without accountability</p>
<p>These refusals are not ideological. They are protective.</p>
<hr />
<h3>10. Keeping the commons clean</h3>
<p>Commons become polluted when:</p>
<p>* stewardship becomes permanent</p>
<p>* rules stop adapting</p>
<p>* care becomes invisible</p>
<p>To keep commons clean:</p>
<p>* rotate roles</p>
<p>* revisit rules</p>
<p>* re-anchor in place</p>
<hr />
<h3>Closing</h3>
<p>Commons are not things we manage.</p>
<p>They are <strong>places we belong</strong>.</p>
<p>When treated as habitat, commons can endure.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>This paper establishes commons as living systems of care. All subsequent papers depend on this framing to avoid enclosure and extraction.</em></p>
