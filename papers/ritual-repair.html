      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        Repair is not simply technical restoration; it is a civic capacity bound up with meaning, trust, and belonging. Rituals — public acts of recognition and reintegration — are central to repair because they stabilize relationships after rupture.
      </p>
      <p>
        This paper treats ritual as practical infrastructure: predictable, rule-guided practices that reestablish norms, distribute responsibility, and hold grief. Rituals are not ornament; they are mechanisms for social metabolism.
      </p>
      <p>
        We propose modest design principles for ritualized repair that support belonging, restore trust, and enable communities to recover while remaining accountable to changed realities.

      <h2>1. Repair as civic capacity</h2>
      <p>
        Repair presumes a shared system worth restoring. Civic repair is therefore an investment in shared capacity: resources, time, and frameworks to address harms and restore cooperative relationships.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Rituals as stabilization</h2>
      <p>
        Rituals mark transitions: they make rupture legible and provide forms for reintegration. Their power lies in predictability, collective participation, and symbolic clarity — all of which help communities move from breakdown to renewed practice.
      </p>

    <section class="block">
      <h2>3. Practices of grief and acknowledgment</h2>
      <p>
        Grief must be socialized. Practices that allow communities to name loss, honor it, and then proceed are essential. Ritualized acknowledgment prevents the festering of resentment and supports durable responsibility.

    <section class="block">
      <h2>4. Trust restoration and reparation</h2>
      <p>
        Repair is both forward and backward looking: it restores relations and adjusts accounts. Trust is rebuilt when obligations are clear, when reparative acts are visible, and when future governance reflects the lessons of failure.
      </p>

    <section class="block">
      <h2>5. Designing repair rituals</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Make rituals accessible: low ceremony can be powerful if regular and public.</li>
        <li>Pair symbolic acts with tangible reparation (material repairs, policy adjustments).</li>
        <li>Institutionalize ritual moments: yearly, after major decisions, and at boundaries of care.</li>
        <li>Train mediators and ritual facilitators as part of civic infrastructure.</li>
        <li>Create shared narratives that do not obscure culpability but make repair possible.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section class="block">
      <h2>Closing questions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>What small, repeatable rituals help communities metabolize institutional failure?</li>
        <li>How to pair symbolic recognition with meaningful reparation?</li>
        <li>Which actors should hold responsibility for convening repair rituals?</li>
        <li>How can rituals avoid becoming mere performance?</li>
        <li>What training and resources do facilitators of repair need?</li>
      </ul>
