      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        These notes gather the series into a short frame: planetary guardianship is an ethic of capacity. It blends boundaries, care, repair, attention, civic regulation, and perceptual infrastructures toward practices that sustain life across ecological time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The paper is not a manifesto but an opening: a set of protocols and lines of practical inquiry — how to govern limits, cultivate repair, design attention, and embed beauty as a stabilizer of stewardship.
      </p>
      <p>
        It concludes with a sketch of next steps: protocol development, localized practice, distributed stewardship, and practice-based research into viability and care.

      <h2>1. Ethics as capacity</h2>
      <p>
        Ethics here is not only principle but practice: the ability of people and institutions to act responsibly under constraint. Capacity includes knowledge, resources, rhythms, and habits that make responsible action possible.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="block">
      <h2>2. Regulation and viability</h2>
      <p>
        Regulation should be read as enabling viability: rules that protect thresholds, support repair, and distribute burdens. Viability is the primary aim; regulation is the tool to sustain viable configurations of life.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="block">
      <h2>3. Attention, commons, and local stewardship</h2>
      <p>
        Attention is a scarce public good. The commons and local stewardship practices allocate attention in visible, consequential ways. Supporting local institutions is a way of distributing sensing and response capacities that national systems cannot hold alone.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="block">
      <h2>4. Repair and perceptual infrastructures</h2>
      <p>
        Repair practices and perceptual infrastructures (beauty, rituals) sustain the emotional and motivational soil for stewardship. They are not soft extras but necessary supports for durable governance.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="block">
      <h2>5. Protocols and practice</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Develop protocol templates for boundary-respecting decision cycles (assessment → delay → review → response).</li>
        <li>Fund standing repair capacities: civic mediation, ritual facilitation, and material repair teams.</li>
        <li>Design civic nervous systems that separate rhythmically distinct channels for fast and slow signals.</li>
        <li>Embed beauty and perceptual care in public maintenance budgets and civic design standards.</li>
        <li>Center differential responsibilities and reparative mechanisms to address uneven burdens.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section class="block">
      <h2>6. A calm opening</h2>
      <p>
        Planetary guardianship is neither centralised command nor purely volunteerism; it is a practiced architecture of shared responsibility. The work ahead is empirical and craft-based: building protocols, testing practices, and learning through localized experimentation that scales by translation rather than replication.
      </p>

    <section class="block">
      <h2>Closing questions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Which protocol elements are portable between contexts, and which must be locally remade?</li>
        <li>How to fund standing repair and attention infrastructures in ways that endure?</li>
        <li>What institutional forms best hold long horizons inside short electoral cycles?</li>
        <li>How to weave beauty, ritual, and repair into ordinary civic budgets and practices?</li>
        <li>Where to begin practice-based research into guardianship that combines craft and policy?</li>
      </ul>
