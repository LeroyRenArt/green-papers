<p>Elia: Love Without Capture</p>
<h3>A Green Paper on relational support, dignity, and care that refuses to become leverage</h3>
<p><strong>Status:</strong> Green Paper (living)</p>
<hr />
<h3>1. Why Elia must exist</h3>
<p>Care that is bound to land anchors responsibility. Care that is bound to people anchors dignity.</p>
<p>Elia names <strong>relational love</strong>—support offered to a human being without converting that support into ownership, debt, or control.</p>
<p>Elia exists because not all care should touch soil.</p>
<p>Some care must touch a person and then <strong>let go</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3>2. Elia is not payment</h3>
<p>Elia is frequently confused with compensation.</p>
<p>This confusion collapses relation into transaction.</p>
<p>Elia:</p>
<p>* does not purchase labor</p>
<p>* does not secure loyalty</p>
<p>* does not guarantee output</p>
<p>* does not justify expectations</p>
<p>Elia supports presence, not performance.</p>
<hr />
<h3>3. Love without capture</h3>
<p>Capture occurs when support becomes leverage.</p>
<p>Elia explicitly refuses capture by removing:</p>
<p>* conditionality</p>
<p>* monitoring</p>
<p>* milestones</p>
<p>* deliverables</p>
<p>Where Elia flows, the receiver remains free.</p>
<hr />
<h3>4. Dignity as the protected good</h3>
<p>Elia protects <strong>dignity</strong>.</p>
<p>Dignity is the right to:</p>
<p>* say no</p>
<p>* change direction</p>
<p>* rest</p>
<p>* disappear</p>
<p>Support that compromises dignity is not care. It is extraction wearing kindness.</p>
<hr />
<h3>5. The asymmetry of care</h3>
<p>Care is often asymmetric.</p>
<p>Elia accepts this without attempting to balance accounts.</p>
<p>Balance-seeking introduces surveillance. Surveillance erodes trust.</p>
<p>Elia chooses trust.</p>
<hr />
<h3>6. Why Elia and Elir must remain distinct</h3>
<p>Elia (relational) and Elir (habitat-bound) are complementary but <strong>not interchangeable</strong>.</p>
<p>When Elia is treated like Elir:</p>
<p>* people become terrain</p>
<p>When Elir is treated like Elia:</p>
<p>* land becomes sentiment</p>
<p>Keeping them distinct keeps both clean.</p>
<hr />
<h3>7. Ceilings and consent</h3>
<p>Elia also carries limits.</p>
<p>Not to ration love, but to prevent dependence.</p>
<p>Limits protect:</p>
<p>* autonomy</p>
<p>* mutuality</p>
<p>* the possibility of exit</p>
<hr />
<h3>8. Elia and nervous-system love</h3>
<p>Elia operates at the scale of the nervous system.</p>
<p>Its measure is simple:</p>
<p>* does the receiver breathe more easily?</p>
<p>* does pressure reduce?</p>
<p>If pressure increases, Elia has failed its own purpose.</p>
<hr />
<h3>9. What Elia refuses</h3>
<p>Elia refuses:</p>
<p>* obligation disguised as generosity</p>
<p>* gratitude as currency</p>
<p>* exposure as repayment</p>
<p>Care that demands visibility is not care.</p>
<hr />
<h3>10. Keeping Elia clean</h3>
<p>Elia becomes polluted when:</p>
<p>* support is tied to identity</p>
<p>* giving becomes branding</p>
<p>* receivers are showcased</p>
<p>To keep Elia clean:</p>
<p>* give quietly</p>
<p>* release outcomes</p>
<p>* honor privacy</p>
<hr />
<h3>Closing</h3>
<p>Elia is love that <strong>does not stay</strong>.</p>
<p>It arrives, supports, and leaves the person whole.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>This paper establishes relational care without capture. All subsequent papers rely on this distinction to protect dignity and freedom.</em></p>
