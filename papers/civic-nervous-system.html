      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        Democracies behave like nervous systems: they sense, amplify, dampen, and adapt. When those sensing and regulatory capacities fail, civic life becomes reactive and prone to polarization. The metaphor directs attention to rhythms, feedback, and repair.
      </p>
      <p>
        This paper explores civic attention as infrastructure: how institutions, practices, and media form feedback loops that either stabilize or destabilize public life. Legitimacy, repair, and attention architecture are central to maintaining collective viability.
      </p>
      <p>
        It offers practical points: create slow channels and fast channels with distinct rules; invest in repair pathways; and design participation that is rhythmically sustainable rather than continuously maximal.

      <h2>1. Sensing and amplification</h2>
      <p>
        Public institutions and media act as sensors. They must detect slow changes (demographic shifts, ecological drift) and acute events. Sensory overload occurs when every signal is treated as an emergency—amplifying noise and eroding deliberation.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="block">
      <h2>2. Rhythms and feedback loops</h2>
      <p>
        Healthy civic systems have rhythms: periods of deliberation, cycles for review, moments for emergency response. Designing feedback loops that are appropriately paced helps prevent oscillation between complacency and panic.
      </p>

    <section class="block">
      <h2>3. Attention infrastructure</h2>
      <p>
        Platforms, institutions, and public rituals distribute attention. Investment in attention infrastructure means designing channels that privilege evidence, mitigate manipulative incentives, and sustain collective attention on long-term matters.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="block">
      <h2>4. Legitimacy, overload, and participation</h2>
      <p>
        Participation is meaningful only when institutions can absorb and respond to inputs. Overloading institutions manufactures cynicism. Legitimacy comes from reliable responsiveness, not from continuous but empty consultation.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="block">
      <h2>5. Repair mechanisms</h2>
      <p>
        Systems will fracture. Civic repair is the set of practices that restore trust and recalibrate relationships—public inquiries, mediated processes, and institutional humility. Repair should be routine and funded, not exceptional.
      </p>

    <section class="block">
      <h2>6. Practical implications</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Design distinct channels for urgent signals and for slow deliberation, with different rules and gatekeeping.</li>
        <li>Build institutional capacity for repair: standing mediation bodies, funded civic repair teams.</li>
        <li>Measure legitimacy not only by participation rates but by absorptive capacity and follow-through.</li>
        <li>Protect civic rhythms: set periods for deep listening separate from news cycles.</li>
        <li>Encourage local institutions as distributed sensors and buffers for national systems.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section class="block">
      <h2>Closing questions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>How do we design attention economies that reward stewardship rather than outrage?</li>
        <li>What institutional forms best absorb citizen input without collapsing under volume?</li>
        <li>Which rituals or practices can slow civic life without silencing urgent voices?</li>
        <li>How to institutionalize repair so it becomes ordinary rather than exceptional?</li>
        <li>What metrics track a civic system’s nervous health?</li>
      </ul>
